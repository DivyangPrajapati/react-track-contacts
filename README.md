# Track Contacts

This is a React-based web application that allows you to manage your contacts. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting contacts. This project was built using React, and we utilized React Router DOM for navigation. We would like to give credit to [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) for providing the navigation code that we have incorporated into this application.
